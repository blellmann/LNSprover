# LNSprover

LNSprover is a Prolog implementation of backwards proof search in modular linear nested
sequent calculi for normal and non-normal propositional modal
logics. It is based on the article

Lellmann, Pimentel: Proof search in nested sequent calculi. In: Davis,
Fenker, McIver, Voronkov (eds.): LPAR-20, pp.558-574, Springer (2015)

(See http://logic.at/staff/lellmann/static/publications/2015/2015LPAR.pdf for the preliminary version.)

For details on usage and the considered logics, see the file readme.pdf
